# memflix

A proof of concept for simple Chrome extension to ease your language-learning process.

The idea is that one you know some basic grammar and 1000 or so basic words you should practise and build immersion.

What better way do do it if not by watching some movie or TV series!

## Problem?

So let's say you want to learn some French.

You open your go-to streaming service, find French movie and pair it with French subtitles.

At the beginning you pause every 2 seconds to lookup the next unknow word and loose all the fun.

## Solution?

Have all the needed vocabulary already ready for you and enjoy your show!

## Roadmap:
- [x] Parse XML-encoded subtitles 
- [x] Save the words into storage
- [x] Fetch the translations from external API
- [x] Choose the language of source and translation
- [ ] Save already-memorised words
- [ ] Try to extract more important words and show those first
- [ ] Handle more subtitle sources (SRT) and drag-and-drop file upload
- [ ] Give access to already-memorised words to enable recaps
- [ ] Auto-detect source language
- [ ] Support multiple languages simultaneously (i.e. learning German and French and ...)
